## Ideas
Spotify/Soundcloud Visualizer

Amazon stock alarm

Bitcoin auto trader - let users choose the algorithm(when to sell and when to buy) or just can simply choose our recommended trading algorithms(one or two). The API is provided from many bitcoin trading exchanges. 

Photo-based Music Recommendations: Allow user to take a photo of anything, a landscape, person, etc, and gives music recommendations. Google has an emotional analysis API, and we can also use color/blur/and location metadata from the photo for music recommendations.

Web browser plugin that acts as a compact media player (music, podcasts, ect) for (Youtube, Soundcloud, Netflix, ect. {start small}) So I don't hafta keep switchin' tabs clumsily when i'm tryna listen to my fav things while i study.

Going off of the Web browser plugin idea above, we could make a small UI for one of the media players that we could pull up via a shortcut while playing games or doing something else that allows us to do simple things like switch the music, select a playlist, or adjust volume. Similar to how Steam has an overlay, or a discord overlay.
