User goes to a party and logs into our app successfully. They then take a picture and a playlist of 10 songs is generated based off the keywords that the Google Vision API generates. As the user listens through the initial set of reccomendations they offer thumbs-up/thumbs-down feedback, which affects which songs are added to the playlist.
