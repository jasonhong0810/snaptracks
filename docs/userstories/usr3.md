# User Story #3

Hunter Chun, Justin Taylor, Jiho Seo, Jason Hong, Joseph Bain

The user remembers a song that he heard on the app that he had really liked it, but forgot the name of the song. He logs back into the app, and clicks a "my liked songs" tab. He then sees a list of songs that he gave a "thumbs up" to in the past with the song name and date of each song and can play any of the songs to find the one he was looking for.
