# User Story #4

Hunter Chun, Justin Taylor, Jiho Seo, Jason Hong, Joseph Bain

A user dislikes a song that is played on the app. He clicks a "thumbs down" button and the song is added to his list of disliked songs. He can then go to a "disliked songs" tab and view the list. Songs on this list will not be played in the future for a similar photo, and the user has the option to remove any song on this list if he changes his mind or makes an accidental click.
